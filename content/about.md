**TL;DR**

Highly motivated, team-oriented software engineer with a track record of developing tools to address novel scientific problems and leading teams in both technical and community settings. Capacity to learn rapidly and commitment to excellence have allowed contributions in neurotechnology, neuroscientific research, defense systems, and data storage infrastructure. Seeking opportunities to learn from expert engineers while contributing to cutting-edge technology.

**My background...**

Originally, I didn't go to college with the goal of becoming a software engineer. I went to UT Austin (hook 'em horns!) and started out as a Neuroscience major on the pre-medical school track. I was always very interested in cognition and the human brain, and I thought the next logical step would be medical school. I finally took my dad's advice (who is a software engineer himself) and enrolled in my first intro level Python programming class during my sophomore year of college. Once I had my first major "aha!" moment when everything we learned in class clicked and I realized how much fun I have solving problems, I had to keep chasing that feeling. I immediately dropped my pre-med status and started studying Computer Science alongside Neuroscience.

Since then, I've had the privilege of working on some really cool and innovative projects. During my first summer software engineering internship at a neuroperformance company called Optios, I adapted their neuroperformance training app (originally specialized for PGA Golf players) for Major League Baseball athletes. I also performed comprehensive tests and developed a test plan for their EEG headset and user interface, which reduced bugs at the hardware/software intersection and improved overall customer experience. This was an awesome opportunity to witness the intersection of Neuroscience and Computer Science in industry and to learn how I can apply my programming/computer science skills to solve real world problems.

After I came back to school in the fall, I joined Dr. Mackenzie Howard’s lab, which operates within the Center for Learning and Memory at UT Austin. As an undergraduate researcher, I designed a Python application that processes and analyzes raw data from hippocampal pyramidal neurons of mice with Dravet syndrome, a genetic epilepsy disorder. This project unveiled the complex underlying mechanism behind Dravet syndrome and the insights it provided have since been incorporated in a published research paper. This experience not only honed my problem-solving skills, but also gave me a newfound appreciation for how Computer Science can drive technological and scientific advancement in various different domains.

More recently, I spent a summer as a software engineer intern at Mach Industries, a defense startup based in Huntington Beach, California. At Mach, I implemented a Monte Carlo simulation framework in Rust for an unmanned aircraft to support development of its flight controller, the hardware component which controls the aircraft’s flight and stability. This involved extending open source flight simulation software in order to generate metrics for vehicle stability and navigation accuracy. I collaborated extensively with aerospace, GNC, and other software engineers to design this innovative and effective internal tool which would be used for future aircraft design updates.

**The present!**

Currently, I'm a full time software engineer at Dell Technologies in Austin, Texas. My team focuses on data mobility in PowerStore, an all-flash storage array used for a variety of business-critical transactional workloads. To ensure that customer data is always accessible, as well as securely and efficiently replicated, I debug and optimize critical Java components of PowerStore's management services. I also add and refine unit tests to improve software reliability, while leveraging Jenkins and RxJava to streamline CI/CD pipelines and improve asynchronous operations.

In addition to working full time as a software engineer, I am pursing my Master's in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. I started the OMSCS program in January of 2025 and I'm looking forward to learning more about robotics and AI/ML!
